Algorithms\u2423\n\u21aaanalyze large datasets to identify patterns and relationships that humans\u2423\n\u21aamight miss or find too complex to detect manually.\n### 1.2 Applications\nMachine learning applications span numerous industries including healthcare,\u2423\n\u21aafinance, transportation, and entertainment. Each domain presents unique\u2423\n\u21aachallenges and opportunities for ML implementation.\n## 2. Types of Learning\n### 2.1 Supervised Learning\nSupervised learning uses labeled training data to teach algorithms to predict\u2423\n\u21aaoutcomes. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs and can then make\u2423\n\u21aapredictions on new, unseen data.\nCommon supervised learning tasks include classification and regression.\u2423\n\u21aaClassification predicts discrete categories, while regression predicts\u2423\n\u21aacontinuous numerical values.\n#",
